### Hi , Welcome to my Profile
I am a small farmer who is passionate about sustainability in food production. I am deeply concerned about the state of the world and am committed to finding ways to improve the way we grow and produce food. As a software engineering student, I am eager to use my skills to innovate and create solutions that can help support sustainable agriculture. 

In my free time, I enjoy working on my family small land and experimenting with new techniques to increase the efficiency and sustainability of our operations. I am always looking for ways to improve and am excited to see where my interests in farming and technology will take me.

Here you'll find my personal projects, portfolio, and open source contributions. These repositories serve as a way for me to share my skills and accomplishments, as well as possibly help with some snippet or piece of code suited for someones need.
